    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database system that falls under the category of non-relational databases. NoSQL, which stands for \"not only SQL,\" is a type of database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in ways other than the tabular relations used in relational databases like SQL.\n",
    "Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are designed to handle various types of data and can be more flexible and scalable than traditional relational databases. Unlike relational databases, which use a structured schema and tables, NoSQL databases can store and retrieve data in various formats such as key-value pairs, document-oriented collections, column-family stores, or graph databases. \n",
    "This flexibility makes them well-suited for handling unstructured or semi-structured data and adapting to changing data requirements.\n",
    "MongoDB, in particular, is a document-oriented NoSQL database, where data is stored in flexible, JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) documents. These documents can have different fields and structures, allowing for dynamic and schema-less data models. MongoDB is known for its scalability, high performance, and ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios where MongoDB might be preferred over traditional SQL databases include:\n",
    "1.Scalability and Performance:\n",
    "  MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers, making it well-suited for handling large amounts of data and high traffic loads. It can distribute data across multiple servers and handle read and write operations efficiently.\n",
    "2.Flexible Schema:\n",
    "  MongoDB's flexible schema allows developers to work with data without a predefined structure. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data structure is evolving or not well-defined upfront.\n",
    "3.Document-Oriented Data:\n",
    "  If your data is naturally represented as a collection of documents (like JSON or BSON), MongoDB provides a natural and efficient way to store and query such data.\n",
    "4.Real-time Applications:\n",
    "  MongoDB's ability to handle large volumes of real-time data makes it suitable for applications that require fast and dynamic access to data, such as content management systems, e-commerce platforms, and real-time analytics.\n",
    "5.Agile Development:\n",
    "  MongoDB's schema-less design allows for more agile development and iteration, as changes to the data model can be made without requiring a complex and time-consuming schema migration process."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB, being a popular NoSQL database, comes with several features that contribute to its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. \n",
    "Here are some key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "1.Document-Oriented:\n",
    "  MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like BSON documents. Each document can have a different structure, and fields can vary across documents in the same collection. This allows for a more natural representation of complex data structures.\n",
    "2.Schema-less Design:\n",
    "  Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not enforce a fixed schema. This means that documents in a collection can have different fields, and new fields can be added without affecting existing documents. This flexibility is beneficial in dynamic and evolving data environments.\n",
    "3.Dynamic Queries:\n",
    "  MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a rich query language. It allows for complex queries, including field selection, sorting, and filtering based on various criteria. Queries can also be expressed as JSON-like documents, making them easy to understand and manipulate.\n",
    "4.Indexing:\n",
    "  MongoDB supports indexing on fields, which enhances query performance by allowing the database to locate and retrieve data more efficiently. Indexes can be created on single fields or combinations of fields, providing flexibility in optimizing query performance.\n",
    "5.Aggregation Framework:\n",
    "  MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows for data transformation and analysis. It supports a pipeline-based approach, where documents pass through various stages, such as filtering, grouping, sorting, and projecting, to achieve the desired result.\n",
    "6.Horizontal Scalability:\n",
    "  MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, allowing for the distribution of data across multiple servers or clusters. This makes it suitable for handling large amounts of data and high traffic loads by adding more servers to the infrastructure.\n",
    "7.Sharding:\n",
    "  MongoDB supports sharding, which is a method of distributing data across multiple servers. Sharding improves horizontal scalability by partitioning data and distributing it among different shards or nodes. This helps in achieving better performance and handling larger datasets."
